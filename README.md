# Laplace-Equation-in-C
A number of potential functions need to be solved in applied Mathematics, Physics and Engineering, and whenever the problems involving potential function occures, there exists "Laplace equation" which is of elliptical type.  The manual analytical solution of Laplace equation is quite cumbersome and time consuming. As programming approach, here is a source code in C program for solution of Laplace equation. The techniques of numerical methods are used to solve this equation, and it involves a number of calculations; efforts have been made to minimize error.  The Laplace Equation has been derived on the consideration that, a heated plate is insulated everywhere except at its edges where the temperature is constant. Assuming that, the plane of plate coincides with xy-plane, the quantity of heat entering the face of plate in time Î”t is calculated.
